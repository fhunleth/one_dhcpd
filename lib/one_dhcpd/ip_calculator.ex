defmodule OneDHCPD.IPCalculator do
  @moduledoc """
  This module handles IP address calculations.

  The most involved of the calculations is the determination of a good IP
  subnet to use. OneDHCPD subnet tries for the following:

  * Subnets should be the same across reboots (convenience and no surprise conflicts)
  * Support running on more than one interface (unique subnets on device)
  * Support hosts than have more than one device (unique subnets between
    devices)
  * Don't conflict with the IPs used on the host for Internet

  The algorithm here is to hash the hostname (uniqueness between devices
  assuming the hostname is unique) and the network interface (uniqueness on
  device). Then use those bits to pick a subnet in the 172.31.0.0/16
  private address range. That private range was picked arbitrarily since
  10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16 ranges are commonly used. 172.18.0.0/16
  is used by Docker.
